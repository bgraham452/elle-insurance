            You can take the first step by notifying the appropriate government agencies. <br /> <br />
            If you were married to the deceased for at least 10 years, the surviving spouse (and even ex-spouse) and surviving children may qualify to receive a one time $255 death benefit from the Social Security Administration. <br /> <br />
            Inquire about survivor benefits that may be available for children under 16 years of age or disabled children of any age.  <br /> <br />
            If the deceased served in the armed forces, there may be Veteranâ€™s Administration survivor benefits that the spouse and children may be entitled to. <br /> <br />
